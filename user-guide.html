    <P>While you don't <strong>have</strong> to follow these steps to feel the impact of HillCid in your everyday life, we think they'll make it easier than ever to get the most out of your subscription.

      It might sound obvious, but saving us as a contact in your phone will help your brain associate our messages with <strong>positivity</strong> and <strong>progress</strong>. After all, a text from â€œHillCid" feels a lot more personal than any other text?
    </p>
    
        <div><li><a href="#" class="subscribe-btn">Step 2: Take Your Time.</a></li></div>
     <P>Because our texts are designed to interrupt the stress of daily life, many of our subscribers open them the moment they come in. Others prefer to save them for later, when they'll have more time to process them.

        <p>Everyone's different, so we recommend experimenting with different times of day to see what works best for you.<br> Some people like to read their texts first thing<strong>in the morning, </strong>while others prefer to reflect on them before bed. You might even find that certain texts resonate more at different times of the day or week.
      Some texts will feel spot-on, like weâ€™re watchi
    </p>
    <p>
      When we text you, itâ€™s personal; youâ€™re the only person in the world to receive that text on that day at that time. Ask yourself:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Why do I need to hear this right now?</li>
      <li>What does this have to do with me?</li>
      <li>How can I apply this to my own life?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      By <strong>searching for meaning</strong> and making an effort to view each text within the context of your life's circumstances, you become an active participant in your own growth ðŸ’ª

     <p> Journaling has been proven to <strong>improve mental and emotional independence and IQ</strong>, making it easier to process complex thoughts and emotions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some texts specifically ask for a response, while others are more open-ended statements that simply get your brainâ€™s wheels turning. Although you never have to text us back, weâ€™ve found that subscribers who regularly respond to our messages have reported the <strong>highest levels of growth</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just like a physical journal, we won't respond, we won't interrupt, and we won't share or judge anything you say. There isn't a counselor on the other end of the lineâ€”Instead, think of Cope Notes as a digital journal thatâ€™s always willing to start the conversation and give you the space to speak freely.

      Want to keep track of your growth over time? Need a little nudge in the right direction? Curious about how you felt a few weeks or months ago?
    </p>
    <p>
      A text that didn't quite click last week may resonate tonight because of something you experienced this morning. You can always scroll through your Cope Notes text thread to find hidden gems from the past, glimpses of perspective for the present, and inspiration for the future. Enjoy!
